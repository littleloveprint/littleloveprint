		<h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>
		<p>My website will be one page with three sections and links to my social media profiles.</p>
		<h2><strong>411:</strong></h2>
		<p>This section will have information on my professional history, showcase my skillset and personality as well as highlight the programming languages I am most familiar with. My hope is to attract the type of employer I work best with through the professional yet fun and creative look and feel of my web app.</p>
		<h2><strong>Portfolio:</strong></h2>
		<p>My portfolio will consist of two sub sections. The web development section will showcase current websites I am working on or have recently completed. The graphic design section will have a few graphics I've created such as logo designs, infographics and flyers.</p>
		<p>Included underneath each sub section will be a short outline of my role(s) in each project.</p>
		<h2><strong>Contact:</strong></h2>
		<p>This section will list my professional email address, my universal at handle (social links also visible), and a contact form.</p>
