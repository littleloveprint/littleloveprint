# Milestone1 feedback

Purpose, Audience, Goal and User Story was perfect and to the point. I was easily able to imagine the persona you created. The use case lays out exactly how someone would use your site. The social media links are a nice touch and should serve you very well.

## clarifications 

One small thing the website you will create is one page so a user will not be able to navigate between pages, but they will be able to navigate between different sections on the page. Also while your directory structure is perfect can you move the CSS directory into documentation. That way you can a have separation of concern with the documentation CSS and the actual sites CSS

### feedback awesome job with Milestone1 this passes at tier IV.
