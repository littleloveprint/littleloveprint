## Milestone1 feedback

Purpose, Audience, Goal and User Story was perfect and to the point. I was easily able to imagine the persona you created. The use case lays out exactly how someone would use your site. The social media links are a nice touch and should serve you very well.

#### clarifications 

One small thing the website you will create is one page so a user will not be able to navigate between pages, but they will be able to navigate between different sections on the page. Also while your directory structure is perfect can you move the CSS directory into documentation. That way you can a have separation of concern with the documentation CSS and the actual sites CSS

### feedback awesome job with Milestone1 this passes at tier IV.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

Great job on making your wireframes and descriptions straight to the point with no fluff. I really like the way you've broken up each section on the desktop wireframe, which will look and flow nicely on mobile as well. If you're attempting to get a position as a frontend developer after bootcamp I think your portfolio section will lend itself nicely to job requirements, and past work highlighting your ability to make things look awesome! :)

According to [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~lmcduffie%2Flittleloveprint%2Fepic%2Fmilestone-2.php) you have no warnings or errors, huzzah! However, I did notice that you left out an important piece of the HTML puzzle, which is: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`. That `<meta>` tag is important for responsive development. I noticed that you have it included in your index.php file, but you've left it out in your milestone 2&alpha;.

Another thing I noticed was your directory structure on GitHub is a little bit off from what is expected, according to [milestone 1 requirements](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/). According to milestone 1 your directory structure should look something like this:

my-pwp-name
* public_html
    * documentation
        * milestone-1.php
* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md

Overall your html is great and I think your PWP is going to come out looking great.

### grade Tier IV - Great job! https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/
