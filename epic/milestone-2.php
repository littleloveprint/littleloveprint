		<h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>
		<p>My website will be one page with three sections and links to my social media profiles.</p>
		<h2><strong>411:</strong></h2>
		<p>This section will have information on my professional history, showcase my skillset and personality as well as highlight the programming languages I am most familiar with. This section (the entire site, actually) will be very professional yet casual as to showcase the type of work environment I am hoping to attract.</p>
		<h2><strong>Portfolio:</strong></h2>
		<p>My hopes are to have three separate, responsive image galleries.
		<ul>
			<li>Graphics (logos, print designs)</li>
			<li>Web (websites I've created)</li>
			<li>Photography (photos I've styled, taken and edited for marketing)</li>
		</ul>
		Included underneath each gallery will be a short outline of my role(s) in each project.</p>
		<h2><strong>Contact:</strong></h2>
		<p>This section will list my professional email address, my universal at handle (social links also listed at top of page), and a contact form.</p>
